# Data Standards for Data Projects 

Data standards will help City users define their data needs when working on a data project, either within City directorates and departments or working with parties external to the City.  It will help create a shared understanding of the best practices for sharing data and data products.

Current siloed approaches lead to blockages when the City or external party want to use the data paid for with residents monies. Creating common data standards can help us create value for residents by ensuring accessibility to data to make better decisions impacting their lives. 

It is hoped that this open approach to establishing data standards will ensure that we follow best practice to streamline the sharing of data within the City and between the City and external parties.  

This is a work in progress, please read through the content and make proposals to improve it.
